# WhiteListing-Tool

I made this so people can request a whitelist for my paid programs or programs that are meant for boosters.

## ✨ WHITELIST REQUEST INSTRUCTIONS ✨

1. **Enter a username** you want to use  
2. **Enter a password** you would like to use  
3. **Click Generate Key** to create your key  
4. **Your serial number will display automatically**  
5. **Enter your Discord @username** (NOT your display name)  
   > This is used if you forget your password or key so I can reset them  
6. **Click Submit Whitelist Request**  
7. **Wait for a message from me** 📩

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️

📝 I will be adding a **Convert to .TXT** button that saves your username, password, and key so you won’t forget them.

For now, you **MUST** write them down yourself and keep them safe.

I’ll post the source code soon as well.
